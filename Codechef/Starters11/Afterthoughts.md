- The Contest was well balanced, with every question containing a cool trick.
- Thirty-two people only solved the 4th question, and I had made some progress in solving it, but my approach was wrong. It was a question based on dp - combinatorics.
- I got a rank of 706 with my rating improving from 1698 -> 1772 â™¥
