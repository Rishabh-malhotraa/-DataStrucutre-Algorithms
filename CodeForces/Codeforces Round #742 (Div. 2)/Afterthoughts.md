# Round 742 (Div 2)

- Rank 5687/22125 (2/6)
- Upsolved till D.
- There were a lot of tricks in this contest.
- I misunderstood question 1, but I quickly corrected my solution.
- In my Second Solution, I did noT calculate XOR in an efficient way
  - Calculating the XOR from a range [0, n]    
- Question 3 had a really neat trick of separating numbers
- Question 4 was also based on carrying; you lose value when there would be a carry => 19 + 23 <  22 + 20 (_when the base is 11_)
