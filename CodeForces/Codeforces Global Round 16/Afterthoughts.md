# Codeforces Global Round 16

- Rank 5496/22137 (4/9)
- I could have solved D2, but I prematurely assumed that it would be very tough. Looking at the solution, I could have given it a fair shot.
- I got Runtime Error on D2, making four wrong submissions, but I am happy to rectify the error and get an AC.
- Upsolve D2 and E (which is a question on trees <3)
