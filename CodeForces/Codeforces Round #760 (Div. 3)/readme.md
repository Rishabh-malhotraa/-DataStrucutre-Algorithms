# Afterthoughts

Trash round, I seriously under-performmed, I could have solved 4 questions but I gave up after 90 minutes, I don't have the stamina to stay focused for 2-3 hours which is really bad.
Q1-Q2 were easy, I had the correct code and approach in Q3 but the helper function I used was returing `int` not `long long` which truncated the result and gave me `WA` ðŸ˜­, I'm seriously really annoyed urghh.
Annoyed because of had I solved it I probably would have gone to solve the 4th one too -_-"
