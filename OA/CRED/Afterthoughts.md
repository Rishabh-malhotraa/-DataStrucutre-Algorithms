# 30th November 2021

- I was really burned out with all the web development I had been doing in the past 3 weeks. Solving DSA question was such a welcomed change. I absolutely loved giving this test, and no more development for me please, for the foreseeable future. [This](https://github.com/Rishabh-malhotraa/Vita) is what I have been working on for the last 3 weeks. Idk I did not like how my mentor was so rude while I was developing this project. It was so annoying ngl.

- Lol, I went on a tangent there. The test was medium level; I really enjoyed the questions selection, I had done all three questions before on leetcode, and the questions were just rephrased versions of LC hard questions!
- Funny backstory, someone asked me to solve the second question of the OA for a pramp interview just a few days back.
