- I gave the test on Ananya's mac. It was so inconvenient because the keybinds were mapped on wrong, and my muscle memory was causing me to do press those which I knew on windows, subsequently causing some random behavior on mac.
- The Questions consisted of 9 MCQs and 2 Programming questions.
- It was a good test, with very relevant questions. There was an emphasis on pointers in the MCQ, which is understandable, but I hate that all those code snippets are in C.
- The two questions were:
  - Variation of Minimum Window Substring, is a hard question, but I have done it before, so it was easy.
  - The second question was on writing a custom comparator function.
