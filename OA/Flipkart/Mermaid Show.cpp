Each year the city of TwoLand organises a mermaid show. All the coins used in Twoland have denominations with squared values
(i.e 1, 4 ,9, 16, 36 and so on with the maximum value of coin of 2500) David wished to see the show this year.
He has an infinite number of coins of each denomination with which to pay the entrance fee. But his father will allow his to
visit the show only if he can successfully calculate all the various combinations of coins he could use to pay 
the entry feee in exact change.

Write an algorithm to help David calculate the number of ways in which he can pay the entry fee.

The output can be large sp print result % 1000000007

Eg:
Input: 4   Output: 2
