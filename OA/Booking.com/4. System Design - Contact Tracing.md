# System Design: Contact Tracing

You have been asked to create a contact tracing application to trace all the individuals who came in contact with an infected person during a global pandemic. This application will help curb the spread of the virus and end the global crisis. The algorithm which finds the contacts has already been developed by a separate team. Design a system to support the following features:

1. Each person who has installed the app and provided the requisite permissions should periodically share their geolocation data as a GeoJSON string.
2. This data should be stored in the database along with the user identifier. The data should always be transmitted with encryption and should be encrypted at rest.
3. When a user is marked as infected, their geolocation data should be queried and passed to the already created contact tracing algorithm. The output of the algorithm is a list of user ids of people who came in contact with the person, along with a boolean field indicating whether they were in close contact or not.
4. The close contacts and non-close contacts should be stored in separate lists and authorities should be notified about each list separately.

Using the diagramming tools available, design a system that implements these features.
