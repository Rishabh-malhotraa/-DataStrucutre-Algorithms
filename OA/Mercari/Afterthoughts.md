# 6th November 2021

- Super Easy test, I completed all three questions in 24 minutes while also maintaining the best practices for making the code modular and declarative!
- I had two repeat questions which I practiced while I did my OA for Twitter in September(which I still haven't heard back from, lol).
- Hopefully, I will hear back from them soon! :D

## UPDATE 1: 15th Novemeber

- I heard back from them. I have my interview scheduled for 18th November 2021.

## UPDATE 2: 18th November

- The interview went really well, the interview lasted for 1 hour, it covered almost all topics of computer science.

## UPDATE 3: 3rd December

- I heard back from HR about my availability for the next round, 13th December. I rescheduled it for the next week, 20th December

## UPDATE 4: 20th December

- I had my culture fit + technical round with an EM at Mercari. It went great; there were a host of [non-technical and technical questions](https://www.notion.so/rishabh-malhotra/Mercari-Interview-II-83167820cb35456f92354fb46e0cc048), it went great. I am satisfied with my performance, let's hope for the best! :3
