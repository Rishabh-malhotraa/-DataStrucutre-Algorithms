- Well having a company specific OA prepeation really do help! I went through like 20 [recently asked questions](https://www.notion.so/rishabh-malhotra/0fe30f268bb8424c8704211715a46236?v=6062fbcc091a4c728d4cc01cc65fd426) on leetcode discuss.
- My questions were unique, but I went through a question with a similar concept, in my 6 hours of OA specific preperation!
- I was able to solve both the questions in 40 minutes, but I had this small error in problem 2, which made me a but nervous because I did not want to mess this test up, so I did a very elaborate debugging for 10 minutes, even though I could have just picked on the error had I just skimmed through my code before going through the main debug process of cout-ing everything LOL.
- This test I feel was super easy, 1 easy and 1 medium (typical)
