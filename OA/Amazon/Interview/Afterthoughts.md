- There was a debacle in my first interview, the meet link, which kind of sucked.
- The second interview was the best. I solved the questions also answered the leadership questions very, very well.
- The third interview was also on the good side. I was able to answer most of the questions and solve the problem well.

- This interview was dreaded. Solving questions was never in doubt, but I messed up one or two leadership questions Urghhhh.
- I hope it's not a significant factor. Regardless I am very disappointed in myself if I were not to get selected, it would be my fault only causes the data-structure questions were straightforward only IMO.
- Let's hope for the best. ðŸ¤ž -- I would give myself 60% chance :(
