# 15th August Karat Online Interview 9:30PM

- Hats off to karat this was one of the most professional interviews I have undetaken, the interviewer was super sweet and super helpful.

- The interview started with a breif introduction of the interviewer and then he asked me to introduce myself, the standard stuff.

## Time Complexity Questions

- The first part of the question contained 3 small coding questions based on algorithms and time complexity.

  - You were given a specific task, followed by a peice of psuedo code, and you need to explain does this psuedo code holistically satisifies the given task. (Basic)
  - The next question was to tell the time complexity of an algorithm. (Easy)
  - In the final question you were given two diffrent implementations to find if once sorted list is contained in the other sorted list completly.
    - One was TC:- O(N+M) while the other was O(Nlog(M))
    - You needed to compare which cases is better and what values of M and N would give a better result.

## Coding Assement

**_Following this the interviewer moved on to coding assement part_**

- The first question was based on _strings_, and funny enough I had done that question as a part of karat archives in leetcode. It was count subdomain question, which actually it could take 30 odd minutes to do but I wrap it quickly.
  I was able to solve the question completly.
- The next question was to Find the longest contiguous subarray in two arrays. Standard **_Dynamic Programming Problem_**
  - I told the interviewer the most brute force solution of O(m\*n!) and then moved on to the dp solution.
  - I was able to code out the dp solution properly but I was using bfs on the dp table to retrieve the subarry, I could have done without it had I been just given a small hint by the interview but ALAS!, in the bfs solution i missed one condition of `s1[i-1] !=s2[j-1]` while termiating the bfs.
  - I could have easily debugged it but the time was over.
  - I was able to solve almost two questions in 45 minutes, it was good but I don't know if I strictly need to solve 2 question, so I cant be very certain but I am hopeful of getting another interview call ü§ûüèª
