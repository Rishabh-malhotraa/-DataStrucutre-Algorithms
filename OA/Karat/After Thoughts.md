# 15th August Karat Online Interview 9:30 PM

- Hats off to karat; this was one of the most professional interviews I have undertaken. The interviewer was super sweet and super helpful.

- The interview started with a brief introduction from the interviewer, and then he asked me to introduce myself, the standard stuff.

## Time Complexity Questions

- The first part of the question contained three small coding questions based on algorithms and time complexity.

  - You were given a specific task, followed by a piece of pseudocode, and you need to explain does this pseudo code holistically satisfies the given task. (Basic)
  - The next question was to tell the time complexity of an algorithm. (Easy)
  - In the final question, you were given two different implementations to find if a sorted list is contained in the other sorted list entirely.
    - One was TC:- O(N+M) while the other was O(Nlog(M))
    - You needed to compare which cases are better and what values of M and N would give a better result.

## Coding Assessment

**_Following this, the interviewer moved on to the coding assessment part_**

- The first question was based on _strings_, and funny enough, I had done that question as a part of karat archives in leetcode. It was a count subdomain question, which certainly could take 30 odd minutes to do, but I wrapped it quickly.
  I was able to solve the question completely.
- The next question was to Find the longest contiguous subarray in two arrays. Standard **_Dynamic Programming Problem_**
  - I told the interviewer the most brute force solution of O(m\*n!) and then moved on to the DP solution.
  - I was able to code out the DP solution properly, but I was using BFS on the DP table to retrieve the subarray, I could have done without it had I been just given a small hint by the interview, but ALAS!, in the BFS solution I missed one condition of `s1[i-1] !=s2[j-1]` while terminating the BFS.
  - I could have easily debugged it, but the time was over.
  - I was able to solve almost two questions in 45 minutes. It was good, but I don't know if I strictly need to solve 2 questions, so I can't be very certain, but I am hopeful of getting another interview call ü§ûüèª

## UPDATE 19-8-21 REJECTED `T-T`

I got the mail from HR, and apparently, they don't have any roles that match with my desired skill, bummer because I felt the interview went amazing, I mean, I couldn't have done any better, but it is what it is, on to the next one :3
