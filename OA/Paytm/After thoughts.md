- Very easy assessment, I was able to solve all the three question.
- Only good question was the sum of cousins
- The day of week question is not a good question to ask in OA. there is no logic used besides the fact you need to know a convoluted way of calculating the same.
- `Move Smaller Node` is also not a good OA question it more of a interview question, the bound on using O(1) memory makes it a good question which could not be tested in OA.
- I expect many student acing this OA.
