# Question 1 - [150]

You are given n pairs of elements where each i'th pair has two values a[i] and b[i]. You have to select exactly k pairs out of the given n pairs. You can also reorder the selected k pairs in any possible way. Let's call the reordered pair indices as p1, p2, ... pk. Then the beauty **B** of an ordering is defined as:

You have to find the maximum possible value of Beauty **B**

Example:

Consider input n: 5k: 3inp:[[4,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,5],[2,7]]

For this case, the pairs [a[i], b[i]] in order are [4,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,5], [2,7] and k=3. Let us pick 3 pairs such that indices p1 = 3, p2 = 4 and p3 = 5. Then the beauty for this ordering = (3 - 1 + 2)*min(4,5,7) = 16.

- **[execution time limit] 1 seconds (cpp)**
- **[input] integer n**
    
    The total number of pairs.1<=n<=10^5
    
- **[input] integer k**
    
    Number of pairs to be selected.1<=k<=1000
    
- **[input] array.array.integer inp**
    
    An n X 2 matrix where inp[i][0] represents value of a in i'th pair and inp[i][1] represents value of b in i'th pair.
    
    1<=a,b<=1000
    
- **[output] integer**

```cpp
int solution(int n, int k, vector<vector<int>> inp) {

}
