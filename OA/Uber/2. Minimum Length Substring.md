## Question 2 - [225]

You are given a binary string of length n.

You have to find a minimum length substring of the above given string such that the count of subsequences of this substring which equal "01" is atleast k.

Your solution will return the length of the minimum length substring. If no such string exists then return -1.

Example:

Consider input n: 8k: 2inp: "11011001"

Expected Output: 3

Then out of all substrings of string "11011001", "011" is the substring of min. length which has number of "01" subsequences atleast 2(exactly 2 in this case).

- **[execution time limit] 1 seconds (cpp)**
- **[input] integer n**
    
    The length of the given string.2<=n<=2*10^5
    
- **[input] integer k**
    
    The value k.0<=k<=10^9
    
- **[input] string inp**
    
    The binary string.
    
- **[output] integer**
    
    An integer denoting length of minimum length substring that has atleast k subsequences equal to "01".
    

**[C++] Syntax Tips**

```cpp
int solution(int n, int k, string inp) {

}
```
