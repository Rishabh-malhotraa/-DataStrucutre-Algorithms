You are given a tree consisting of *n* nodes. Out of these *n* nodes, you may choose any node as root from where you will start the path. Now, you may go from your current node to any node to which it is directly connected via an edge. Each edge i of the tree is given in input as three integers u[i], v[i] and w[i] which denotes an edge connecting u[i] and v[i]. Via edge {u[i], v[i] , w[i]}, you can go both ways( either from u[i] to v[i] or v[i] to u[i]) but going from u[i] to v[i] will cost you w[i] units while going from v[i] to u[i] will cost you **0** units. You can not go back to the node you came from and will finally stop at some leaf node. Consider all possible paths from the root to each of the leaf nodes. Then the cost of each path is the sum of costs encountered at each edge as per the rules given above. The maximum among all of these path costs is the **leaf path cost** for that particular **root**.

Your task is to choose a root(starting point) such that your leaf path cost is as minimum as possible. The solution will output the minimum value of leaf path cost considering every node as root.

Example:

Consider input n: 6edges:[[1,2,5],[1,3,10],[2,4,2],[3,5,3],[6,5,2]]

Expected Output: 7

In the above figure, choosing 3 as root will give the minimum leaf path cost. Taking 3 as root, only 4 and 6 are leaf nodes. Hence, there are two paths in total, one from 3 to 4 and one from 3 to 6. The cost of path from 3 to 4 is 0 + 5 + 2 = 7 and for 3 to 6 is 3 + 0 = 3. Hence, the leaf path cost when 3 is root is max(7, 3) = 7.

Note that choosing 1 as root will give leaf path cost as 13.
