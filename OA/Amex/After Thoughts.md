# 16th August Amex Online Assesment

- Firstly I though I wasn't shortlisted since my name was not in the first list so I did not even know that we had a test from Amex today, I got a message from one of my friends and then I checked my mail and I had the link.
- The test was easy one questions was directly taken from leetcode and the 2nd one was just the basic implementation of \_\_gcd
- The 3rd question was actually a novel question and I have never seen a question like that before, I was able to do it in O(N) time but somehow it did not pass 3/4 completness test (stress testing Time Complexity)

- Score was **80%** _{100%, 100% , 41%}_

- I don't know if I would be shortlisted for interview but lets see, I wouldn't be suprised If I do and if I dont.
