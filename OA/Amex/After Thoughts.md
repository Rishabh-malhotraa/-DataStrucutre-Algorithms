# 16th August Amex Online Assessment

- Firstly, I thought I wasn't shortlisted since my name was not on the first list, so I did not even know that we had a test for Amex today. I got a message from one of my friends, and then I checked my mail, and I had the test link.
- The test was easy; one question was directly taken from Leetcode, and the 2nd one was just the basic implementation of `__gcd(a,b)`
- The 3rd question was a novel, and I had never seen a question like that before. I was able to do it in O(N) time, but somehow, it did not pass the 3/4 completeness test(stress testing Time Complexity) and only passed 4/6 for correctness.

- Score was **80%** _{100%, 100% , 41%}_

- I don't know if I would be shortlisted for interviews but let's see, I wouldn't be surprised If I do or don't.
