- I prepared alot of my core subjects for the interviews and revised all my core concepts, and got up early in the morning (I sleep only was 3 hours geez) and my interview did not happen until 1:PM I felt so sleep deprived, but both of my interviews went great, the interviewer was reallly sweet, both of them. Lets see If I get in, hoping for the best. 🤞🏻

- I got in, the first interveiw I sat for on campus is the first interveiw I got in.
