# 1st September 2021

- Obviously, I could not have possibly completed the mentioned requirements in the specified time.
- Firstly, I tried making the frontend login page by copying that from caucus, then the interviewer asked me to focus on the design and implementation part of it.
- My gesture pad came in clutch, it's relatively easy to explain using that, and I could explain all my thought processes.
- I seriously lack in my backend knowledge, I have a lot of front-end knowledge though.

## I got in ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ (2nd September)

The hr called me; the stipend is ~ 35K, but I am reluctant to join as I want to continue to practice DSA, and I already have internships from Zomato and Amex.
