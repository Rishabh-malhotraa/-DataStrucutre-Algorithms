- Obviously I could not have possibly completed the mentioned requirements in the specified time.
- Firstly I tried making the frontend login page by copying that from caucus, then the interviewer was like focus on the design and implementation part of it.
- My gesture pad came in clutch, its relatively easy to explain using that, and I was able to explain all my thought processes.
- I am seriosuly lacking in my backend knowledge, I have alot of front-end knowledge though.
