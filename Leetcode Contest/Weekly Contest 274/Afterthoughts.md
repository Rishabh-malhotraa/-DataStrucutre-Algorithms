- 4 Day VC Streak -> Lets push it to atleast 7 days then take some rest.
- My recruiter mailed me that he has the result for my google Interviews, at this point I feel its just an ego boast tbh, I wouldn't be that bummed about not going to Warsaw, but regardless if you get Google you take it!
- He will tell me the result tomorrow my results, lets see what happens.
- This LC contest was so unbalenced, the first three were so easy and the last question was bonkers
- The last questions was perhaps one of the most difficult questions I have attempted on Leetcode
- Some crazy Graph question with cycle detection and what not ._.
