- I solved three questions (correctly submitted 2)
- The last question gave me TLE because I used `unordered_map<int,int>` instead of `vector<int>`
  - map has O(1) retrieval time AMORTIZED; it could go up to O(N) because of chain collision.
- It's really frustrating to have the correct code but have these kinds of silly blunders; now I have to wait one more week in hopes of improving my rating.
