- Just gave this contest while waiting for my google result, D: the recruiter told me the feedback was mixed, and I only have myself to blame, like literally, I could have solved the questions on which I struggled easily, but I got nervous, but after the first day i crushed the remaining two
- This was my first LC contest in which I could solve all the questions.
- I had two stupid errors, and I got two WA, urghh mann.
  - `long long` will forever haunt me
  - I was aware of the bug which gave the WA before submitting, and I also fixed it, but I submitted the stale copy of the file on which the bug was not corrected T-T
- All and all I am happy with the performance in this contest, but with some fine turing I can easily get 2000 rating on leetcode NOCAP.
- ü§ûüèªfor Google but regardless, MS is a good backup to have but I really hope that this works out `:)`.
