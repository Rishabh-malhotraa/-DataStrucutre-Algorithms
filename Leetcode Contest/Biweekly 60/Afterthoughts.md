- I solved three questions (correctly submitted 2)
- The last question gave me TLE because I used `unordered_map<int,int>` instead of `vector<int>`
  - map has O(1) retireval time AMORTIZED it could go upto O(N) because of chain collision.
- Its really frustrating to have the correct code but have these kind of silly blunders, now I have to wait one more week in hopes of improving my rating.
