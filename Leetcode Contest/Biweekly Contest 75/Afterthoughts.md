- Fairly easy Leetcode contest
- I'm happy that I can consistently solve 3 questions for most of the contest, and make some siginificant progress for the fourth question.
- I miss the trick for the third question and spent alot of time on it which was meh!
- The fourth questions was a Zarray question it could have also been done with rolling hash too `~.~`
  - I tried to solve it using trie lol; wherver I hear prefix I just go the trie route lol.
