- I'm really enjoying giving VC's everyday, _lets have a streak of 10VC_ `^_^`
- I was able to solve the first three questions very easily in 30 minutes.
- The last question was very good binary search questions, which had a very easy implementation but it had a very difficult intuition to catch.
- Still waiting for the Google result, I am not very hopeful tbh, but lets hope for the best `:D`
