- Happy Republic Day `^^`
- All and all the questions were relevant and of really good quality.
- This was a super Hard round, I would have only been able to solve one question in contest setting.
- The Second question was a really sliding window implementation question.
- The Third question was a good Trie questions, I was able to figure out the similarities with the anagram questions and was able to understand that prefix-hash or trie was the way to go! -- but implementing it was difficult.
  - A good realisation that dfs way (skipping) and substr would give the same TC, but susbtr is so much more concise and easy to understand.
- I still don't fully understand  the forth question, ngl; I know how it works but greedy questions I feel are the hardest if you are not able to build up the correct intuition
  - Now I do after spending 40 more minutes pondering over the solutions.
