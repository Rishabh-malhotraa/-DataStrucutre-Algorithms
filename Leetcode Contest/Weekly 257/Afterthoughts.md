# 5th September (happy teacher's day)

- I'm super annoyed that I was only able to solve the first questions
- I spent 1:25 minutes trying to solve the second question ðŸ˜¡.
- I wrote the working code but had some logical blunders because I did not read the question correctly (_those are the most annoying_).
- Rank 3563/12542 (PS: It would be under 1.5k had I submitted my code correctly, urghh!)
